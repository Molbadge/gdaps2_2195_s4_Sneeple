_This README contains basic information about the project and its artifacts. If kept up to date, it will act as a primary dashboard for the project._

## Team
- Valentin Parafioriti
- Molly Badger
- Szun Kidd Choi
- Seb Barnes

## Goals
The primary goals of this project are the following:
1. Practice with the development of a larger project over the course of a semester
2. To gain experience working as a part of a small team
3. To implement a variety of game-related algorithms 
4. To implement data structures for a game 
5. To have fun making a game

## Mission Statement
_From this project, we want to be able to create a piece we are proud enough of to display on our portfolios. 
We also wish for this to be a learning experience from multiple aspects, such as time management, collaboration, programming skills, as well as code analysis and refactoring.
Most importantly, though, we want this to be a fun and enjoyable experience!


## Communications

### Discord
_Add info about how to join/use your team's Discord channel. What is it?_
Discord will primarily be used for any communication outside of meetings and the classroom -
	we will use it to bounce ideas, ask for help, as well as provide updates, among other things.
Images of diagrams and whiteboard scribbles will be uploaded onto the channel as well,
	to ensure everyone is on track with material covered/discussed.


### Meeting Times
Thursdays 9pm, weekly via Discord
